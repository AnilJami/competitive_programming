PROBLEM STATEMENT
A positive integer is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.  Integers containing leading zeros are not valid.  For example, 12321 is a palindrome, but 123210 is not.  You are given an int K.  Return the K-th palindrome, where the 0th palindrome is 1, the 1st palindrome is 2, etc.
